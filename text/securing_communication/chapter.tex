The underlying communication protocol that was created for this application is described in this chapter. More specifically the header structure, types of messages and the connection initialization. The second part of this chapter will describe possible approaches to attacking this protocol and techniques that prevent such attacks.

A Wireshark dissector script has been created for the protocol that will be described in this chapter. This is a Lua script that can parse raw data into a defined protocol structure in Wireshark. Examples of captured messages and a guide on using Wireshark together with this Lua script can be found in Appendix \ref{ch:wireshark}.
