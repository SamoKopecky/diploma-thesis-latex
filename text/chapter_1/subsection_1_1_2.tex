Unlike block ciphers, stream ciphers encrypt one bit at a time instead of blocks. The main principle behind stream ciphers is the bit operation XOR and PRNG (\acl{PRNG}). The key is the randomly generated by the PNRG function. Then the message is XORed with generate key. The XOR operation can also be rewritten as mod $2$ and such we can describe the encryption process with the following equation:

\begin{equation}
  c = e(p)\equiv p + k\ \mathrm{mod}\,2
\end{equation}

\noindent and the decryption process:

\begin{equation}
  p = d(c)\equiv c + k\ \mathrm{mod}\,2
\end{equation}

\noindent for $c$ as the ciphertext, $p$ as the plaintext, $k$ as the secret key $e$ and $d$ as the encryption and decryption functions respectively\cite{Paar2010}.

Examples of stream ciphers include RC4 and Salsa20 (ChaCha20). It is no longer recommended to use the RC4 cipher\cite{Ristic2014}. Salsa20 is a newer stream cipher and is considered to be resident even against quantum computers \cite{Bernstein149}.
