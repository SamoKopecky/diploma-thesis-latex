Cryptography is an essential part of Internet communication. It makes sure an~established connection has three required properties \cite{Bernstein149}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{confidentiality}\,--\,data can't be read by 3rd parties,
  \item \textbf{integrity}\,--\,data can't be edited by 3rd parties,
  \item \textbf{authenticity}\,--\,communicating parties can't be impersonated.
\end{itemize}
Many cryptographic primitives, algorithms and specifications exist in cryptography to ensure the aforementioned properties. The most commonly used protocol that utilizes these algorithms and~specifications is TLS (\acl{TLS}).

Building blocks for cryptographic algorithms are cryptographic primitives. These are~mathematical problems that can be solved in polynomial time ($O(n^x)$) with the~knowledge of some secret. Without the knowledge of this secret, the problem can only be solved in exponential time ($O(x^n)$). This means if a new algorithm is~found that can solve the problem without the knowledge of the secret in polynomial time, the underlying cryptographic primitive is broken and can no longer be safely used in any cryptographic algorithms or specifications.\cite{Smart2004}

Cryptography can be split into symmetric cryptography and asymmetric cryptography. These groups and their underlying cryptographic primitives will be described in more detail in the following sections (sections \ref{sec:symmetric_enc} and \ref{sec:asymmetric_enc}).
