\chapter{The threat of quantum supremacy}

Describe what is the current state of classical cryptography. Mention which groups of modern cryptography qc can break (symmetric, hash, asymetric). Mention that the current key lengths for RSA, DSA are not sufficiently big enough to resist quantum computers. Describe how quantum computers can break modern cryptography (Shors algorithm.). Hint the next chapter for solution to this threat.
