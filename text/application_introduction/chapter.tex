Application that is described in this thesis is implemented in the Go programming language. As the public key algorithms CRYSTALS-Kyber and CRYSTALS-Dilithium are chosen. AES is chosen as the symmetric key encryption algorithm. Additional sections in this chapter explain why these choices were made and shortly introduce the chosen tools. The keyword \textit{modular} in the thesis name is signifies algorithm modularity in the implementation. This means that any other algorithm can be easily plugged in to the application without any massive code code changes. How the modularity of algorithms works will explained in chapter \ref{ch:app_capab}.
