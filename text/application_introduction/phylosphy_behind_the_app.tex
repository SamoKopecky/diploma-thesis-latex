The main philosophy of this application was inspired by a network protocol called Wireguard \cite{Donenfeld2020} and a book The Art of UNIX Programming \cite{Raymond2003}. It is meant to be a simple and small application for sending arbitrary amount of data using only post quantum cryptography. The 4 main ideas that are incorporated in the application are
\begin{itemize}
  \item small traffic overhead,
  \item text based interface,
  \item modularity,
  \item extensibility.
\end{itemize}
These 4 ideas are introduced in the following sections.


% - text based interface
% - preconfigured protocols
% - only 1 round trip plus tcp
% - only a few error messages
% - gui
% - small header
