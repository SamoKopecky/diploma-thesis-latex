The main philosophy of this application was inspired by a network protocol called Wireguard \cite{Donenfeld2020} and a book The Art of UNIX Programming \cite{Raymond2003}. It is meant to be a simple and small application for sending arbitrary amounts of data using only post-quantum cryptography. The 4 main ideas that are incorporated into the application are
\begin{itemize}
  \item small traffic overhead,
  \item text-based interface,
  \item modularity,
  \item extensibility.
\end{itemize}
These 4 ideas are introduced in the following sections.
