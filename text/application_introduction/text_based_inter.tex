From the start this application was designed to be mostly used in UNIX-like systems (but also supports other platforms like Windows). Most of UNIX programs and applications use a text based interface, this way its very easy to redirect an output of one program to the input of another program and vice versa. That is why this application is also designed to use the universal text interface so that it can easily interact with other UNIX programs. The data to send can be redirected via a pipe into the application. Received data can be saved to a file via redirecting its output. For more information about the capabilities of this application refer to chapter \ref{ch:app_capab}
