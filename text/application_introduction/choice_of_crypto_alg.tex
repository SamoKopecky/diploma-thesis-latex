As mentioned in \ref{sec:nist} a group of three lattice based algorithms have been standardized, which Kyber and Dilithium are a part of. That is the main reason why they are chosen as the public key algorithms for this thesis. Each of them have their respective chapter (\ref{ch:kyber} and \ref{ch:dilithium}) that describe some implementation aspects and also introduce some theoretical background that makes them secure.

As for symmetric cryptography AES is chosen with the key size of 256\,bits. AES is used in modern cryptography as the main symmetric cipher and is also usable in post-quantum cryptography but requires a bigger size of the key, due to the threat of Grovers algorithm. Used hash functions in this application are SHAKE-128/256 for the implementing of Kyber and Dilithium following the authors recommendations. SHA3-512 is used by the networking part of the application. A summary of the chosen cryptographic algorithms can be found in the table bellow (table \ref{tab:choosen_algs}).
