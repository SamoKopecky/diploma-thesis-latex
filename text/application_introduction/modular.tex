Modularity in this case means that any other post-quantum algorithm can be easily plugged into the application without any massive code changes. This allows anyone to just add their preferred algorithm to the application in a relatively short time and without the knowledge of the whole code base. How algorithms can be added is detailed in section \ref{sec:algs_modularity}.
