This application is made to be extensible, which means it is very easy to use the underlying communication protocol for sending arbitrary amount of data and extend it with additional functionality. For example if another programmer wants to implement a new GUI (\acl{GUI}), the application was programed in a way where its easy to use the underlying secure communication protocol. The programmer doesn't have to understand how the protocol works, he just needs to know how to use it.
