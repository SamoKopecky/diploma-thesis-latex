This application is made to be extensible, which means it is very easy to use the underlying communication protocol for sending arbitrary amounts of data and extending it with additional functionality. For example, if another programmer wants to implement a new GUI (\acl{GUI}), the application was programmed in a way where it's easy to use the underlying secure communication protocol. The programmer doesn't have to understand how the protocol works, he just needs to know how to use it. More specifically it uses a Go feature called channels for sending and receiving data. When data is sent to the channel it is automatically encrypted and similarly, if some data is received from a channel it is already verified and decrypted.
