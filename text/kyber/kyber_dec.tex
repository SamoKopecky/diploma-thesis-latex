Similarly, as with the encapsulation process, the decapsulation process requires the~decryption function to be defined. The decryption process contains only a few calculations and is illustrated by a~figure, specifically \ref{img:cpapke_dec}. It begins with decoding and decompressing the parameters $u$ and $v$ from the ciphertext. Additionally, $u$ is transformed into the NTT domain. The private key is also decoded into the vector \rmhat{s}. The actual decryption begins by multiplying \rmhat{s} and \rmhat{u} and transforming the~product from the NTT domain. It is then subtracted from $v$ compressed and decoded to get the original message $m$. After the message is decrypted it can be used to generated the same key $K$ that will be used further.
