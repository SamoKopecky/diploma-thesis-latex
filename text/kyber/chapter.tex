CRYSTALS (\acl{CRYSTALS}) Kyber is a~quantum resistant KEM  standardized in the 3rd round of the NIST standardization process. It is based on a modified version of the LWE problem (section \ref{subsec:ntru_lwe}) called MLWE (\acl{MLWE}). Lattices have a solid theoretical security foundation because they have been researched for a long time and are not a new invention. NIST has concluded in their report of their 3rd round of standardization that Kyber has sufficient security against quantum computer attacks. Even in the worst-case scenario where the development of quantum computers is underestimated. As to performance, it has been shown that Kyber is the fastest algorithm amongst the other lattice KEM NIST finalists when it comes to key generation, encapsulation and decapsulation in software and hardware. \cite{Grimes2020}\cite{Alagic2022}
