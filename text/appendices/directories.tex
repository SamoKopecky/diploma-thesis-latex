This application uses some fixed directory paths to store or load files. Their location depends on the operating system the application is running on. The directories that are used on Unix-like systems are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item config\,--\,\texttt{\$HOME/.config/pqcom}
  \item cookie\,--\,\texttt{\$HOME/.cache/pqcom}
  \item log\,--\,\texttt{\$HOME/.local/state/pqcom}
\end{itemize}
\noindent On Windows systems these directories are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item config\,--\,\texttt{\$HOME\textbackslash .config\textbackslash pqcom}
  \item cookie\,--\,\texttt{\$HOME\textbackslash .cache\textbackslash pqcom}
  \item log\,--\,\texttt{\$HOME\textbackslash.pqcom\textbackslash logs}
\end{itemize}
