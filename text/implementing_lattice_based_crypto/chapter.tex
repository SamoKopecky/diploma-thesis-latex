As mentioned in \ref{sec:nist} three algorithms have been standardized that are based on lattice cryptography. This chapter will describe two of these algorithms in more detail, namely CRYSTALS-Kyber and CRYSTALS-Dilithium. Their respective sections will also describe some implementation aspects of these algorithms in the programming language Go. Go is a relatively new programming language compared to others (2009) as of writing this \cite{Donovan2016} and its detailed characterization will follow in the next section of this chapter. This thesis will in the future also contain a client-server application for exchanging messages also programmed in Go and will utilize only quantum resistant algorithms.
