As with Kyber, Dilithium was implemented using only the standard go libraries and one external library \cite{00fV2cvg7Z6H2tS3} that contains implementations for \texttt{SHAKE-128} and \texttt{SHAKE-256}. Dilithium can be implemented in two ways, the first is with using a bigger public key but less complex computations. The other option is implementing a more complex algorithm which has a smaller public key by a factor of more then half. For this thesis the more complex implementation was chosen. The algorithm is explained at a very basic level in figure \ref{img:dil_all}. The small letter at the beginning of arrows denoted the size of the object. At first the public/private keys are generated then the private keys is used in the signing process. A signature is generated which then can be verified by anyone who owns the related public key. Following sections explain all of these steps in more detail which also contain code snippets.

Table \ref{tab:dil_sec_levels} shows the individual parameters for each of the Dilithium parameter sets. The implementation in this thesis contains only Dilithium 2. When a parameter is relevant for the process being explained it will be mentioned and explained in that scenario instead of all the parameters being explained in this section,
