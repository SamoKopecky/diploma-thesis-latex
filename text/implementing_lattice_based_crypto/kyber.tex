CRYSTALS (\acl{CRYSTALS}) Kyber is a~quantum resistant KEM (\acl{KEM}) standardized in the 3rd round of the NIST standardization process. It is based on modified version the LWE problem (s1ection \ref{subsec:ntru_lwe}) called MLWE (\acl{MLWE}). Lattices have a solid theoretical security foundation because they been researched for a long time are not a new invention as of writing this. NIST has concluded in their report of in their 3rd round of standardization that Kyber has sufficient security against quantum computer attacks. Even in the worst case scenario where the development of quantum computers is underestimated. As to performance it has been shown that Kyber is the fastest algorithm amongst the other lattice KEM NIST finalists when it comes to key generation, encapsulation and decapsulation in software and hardware. \cite{Grimes2020}\cite{Alagic2022}
