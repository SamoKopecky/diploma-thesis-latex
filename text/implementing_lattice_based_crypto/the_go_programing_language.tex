The first iteration of the Go programming language was created at Google. It is an open-source programing language and has many similarities with C which means it is also a compiled language and a statically typed language. In a statically typed language a variable has to have a type assigned to it before the compilation process. A compiler translates the source program into an executable, which can be ran multiple times without the need to compile again \cite{Aho2006}. This makes Go faster then any interpreted language like Python in most cases, since an interpreted needs to translate the source code every time it needs to run.

However unlike C it has a garbage collector, that means it has an automatic memory management. In C a programmer has to manage memory on its own, allocated and free it by using functions. Go and its garbage collector take care of allocating and freeing memory which makes it a lot less error prone when it comes to memory management.

Go was also designed to make high performance network applications...
