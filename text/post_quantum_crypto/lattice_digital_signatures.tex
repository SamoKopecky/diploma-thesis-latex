As described in \ref{sec:asymmetric_enc}, digital signatures are another branch of public key cryptography. Many of the same cryptosystems used for public key encryption can be converted into digital signature schemes, for example booth GGH and NTRU. However the basic versions of these signature schemes have some security flaws that cause them to unusable in practice. \cite{Bernstein2009}

The situation with LWE-based cryptosystem is different. Digital signature schemes that use the LWE problem or a modified version of it called MLWE (\acl{MLWE}) are also very good candidates for standardization by NIST, for example the digital signature scheme CRYSTALS-Dilithium \cite{Grimes2020}. More information on the topic of standardization can be found in section \ref{sec:currently_standardized}.
