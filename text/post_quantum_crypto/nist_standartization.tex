NIST (\acl{NIST}) started a standardization process in 2017 for the field of post-quantum public-key cryptography. The first call for submissions was initiated in December of 2016, where 69 post-quantum algorithms were accepted into the first round of standardization. As of writing this thesis the latest round -- the third round -- ended on July 2022. The result was a standardization of 1 KEM protocol and 3 Digital signature protocols, for more details refer to~table \ref{tab:pqc_standardized}. Additionally 4 more post-quantum algorithms will be advancing to the fourth round of standardization, more information can be found in table \ref{tab:pqc_forth_round}. \cite{Alagic2022}
