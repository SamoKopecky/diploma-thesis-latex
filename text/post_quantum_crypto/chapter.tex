Quantum supremacy may not be happening right now but may happen in the future. New public key algorithms need to be standardized so they can be used as replacements for quantum vulnerable algorithms such as RSA and ECDH. NIST (\acl{NIST}) has begun the first standardization process for post-quantum algorithms, which are algorithms that are resistant to the future threat of quantum computers \cite{Chen2016}. The main candidates that will be described  in individual sections are
\begin{itemize}
  \item Lattice-based cryptography,
  \item Code-based Cryptography,
  \item Hash-based digital signature schemes.
\end{itemize}
