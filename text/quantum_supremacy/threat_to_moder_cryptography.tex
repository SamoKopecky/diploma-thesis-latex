The future impact of quantum computers on classical cryptography can be seen in table \ref{tab:impact_of_quantum}. ECC (\acl{ECC}) algorithms and RSA aren't secure from quantum computers with sufficient amount of qubits using the the Shor's algorithm. Currently it is estimated that the required amount of qubits for Shor's algorithm to be efficient enough is in the tens of millions \cite{Bernstein149}\cite{Mosca2015}. IBM managed to create a 127-qubit quantum processor in 2021 so humanity is not yet at the point where everyday internet communication using public key cryptography can be broken using quantum computers \cite{0MBNdFRCTLK35MFY}. 

Although that doesn't change the fact that future quantum computers might be able to. It fact IBM has projected in their new roadmap to a practical quantum computer, that by 2026 they expect to have working quantum computers that contain between 10 000 to 100 000 qubits \cite{Gambetta2021}. However research shows that in order to use quantum algorithms such as Shor's algorithm to break modern cryptography, millions of qubits are required \cite{Bernstein149}. Still a~replacement for the current public key algorithms needs to be found. Each of the new candidates will be discuses in detail in chapter \ref{ch:pq_crypto}.

Symmetric cryptography and hash functions on the other hand are much more resistant to quantum computers. For the current ciphers and algorithm to be quantum-resistant only the symmetric key size and digest size for hash functions needs to increase. For example in the case of AES-128 it is sufficient enough to switch to AES-256 where the performance hit is negligible \cite{Bernstein149}.
