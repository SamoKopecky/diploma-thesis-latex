Modern cryptography described in chapter \ref{ch:state_of_crypto} was designed with the assumption that the adversary would only have access to a classical computer. It turns out many of the algorithms and schemes used in modern cryptography are extremely vulnerable to quantum computers given the quantum computers has enough computational power~\cite{Bernstein2009}. The following sections will explain what are quantum computers, how can they break classical cryptography and exactly which parts are vulnerable to~quantum computers.

% Mention which groups of modern cryptography qc can break (symmetric, hash, asymetric). Describe how quantum computers can break modern cryptography (Shors algorithm.). Hint the next chapter for solution to this threat. Describe the current state of quantum computers, explain how they work (smplified). What are the best quantum computers to date. A historical view of quantum computers.
