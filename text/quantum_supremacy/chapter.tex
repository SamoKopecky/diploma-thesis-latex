Modern cryptography described in chapter \ref{ch:state_of_crypto} was designed with the assumption that the adversary would only have access to a classical computer. It turns out many of the algorithms and schemes used in modern cryptography are extremely vulnerable to quantum computers given the quantum computer has enough computational power~\cite{Bernstein2009}. Reaching a threshold of a powerful enough quantum computer is also called quantum supremacy. The following sections will explain what are quantum computers, how can they break classical cryptography and exactly which parts are vulnerable to~quantum computers.
