A speed performance benchmark can be ran on all of the post-quantum algorithms\,--\,digital signatures and key encapsulation methods\,--\,that are added to the application using the modularity system. The benchmark can be ran with the \texttt{benchmark} command. The benchmark first generates the public/private key pair and then depending on the algorithm either encrypts/decrypts a shared key or signs/verifies some data. The flag \texttt{-i} can be used to specify the amount of iterations.
