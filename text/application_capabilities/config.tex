To choose what post-quantum algorithms will the application use, a configuration file is used. It is in a JSON format and 4 keys can be configured
\begin{itemize}
  \itemtt{kem\_alg}KEM used for key exchange between clients,
  \itemtt{sign\_alg}digital signature algorithm for creating/verifying signatures during the initial communication,
  \itemtt{public\_key}base64 encoded string of the public key,
  \itemtt{private\_key}also a base64 encoded string of the private key.
\end{itemize}
Similarly, as with the \texttt{app} command the \texttt{config} command servers to logically separate subcommands. In this case, it's the \texttt{list} and \texttt{gen} commands. The latter is used for generating a new configuration file with all of the keys filled out and the former is for listing available algorithm names. These algorithms can be seen in appendix \ref{ch:available_algs}.

While generating a configuration file the first two keys for the choice of algorithms can be configured using flags \texttt{-\--kem} and \texttt{-\--sign}. By supplying a string parameter to these flags the algorithm name is chosen. The selection of algorithms is generated from the source code which defines the algorithms and their functions. To get a better understanding of how these algorithms are defined in code, refer to section \ref{sec:algs_modularity}. The other two keys for the public/private key are generated depending on the choice of algorithms. If no algorithms are selected, default algorithms are used. Finally, two configuration files are generated one for the client and one for the server. The client's configuration file contains the public key of the server and his private key. The same can be said for the server where he has the client's public key and his private key (illustrated by figure \ref{img:config_keys}). This is necessary for the initial communication establishment phase of the underlying protocol. See chapter \ref{ch:network_com_sec} for more information.
