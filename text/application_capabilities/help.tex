These two commands are present in any Cobra application by default. The command \texttt{help} is self-explanatory and provides information about a given command, like its description and flags. Another default command is the \texttt{completion} command which provides scripts that add the autocomplete feature to the application's commands. Autocomplete provides the user with the completion of available commands when pressing the tab key.
