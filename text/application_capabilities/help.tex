These two commands are present in any Cobra application by default. The command \texttt{help} is self-explanatory and provides information about a given command, like its description and flags. Another default command is the \texttt{completion} command which provides scripts that add the autocomplete feature to the application's commands. Autocomplete provides the user with the completion of available commands when pressing the tab key. The installation of the autocomplete functionality depends on the environment. For example if on Linux the running shell is bash, the output of the completion command needs to be copied to the \texttt{.bashrc} file. After reloading the terminal autocomplete should now work on the compiled binary.
