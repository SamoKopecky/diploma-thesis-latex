This mode is the opposite of the \texttt{receive} command since it is a write-only mode, where the user can send data to another user. Similarly the user can choose to send data in two ways
\begin{itemize}
  \item using the output of another command as the input via the pipe (|) operator,
  \item reading the contents of a file by supping the path to it.
\end{itemize}
Again the default approach when flags are not supplied is utilizing the first option. The flag \texttt{-\--file [path]} is used for supplying the file path to the input file.
