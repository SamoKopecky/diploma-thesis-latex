The main purpose of this application is to create a secure post-quantum communication channel, through which users can send data. The communication mode can be used by invoking the command \texttt{app} together with the 3 sub commands which are described in subsections. Additionally every subcommand contains 4 shared flags where 3 of the 4 flags are used for altering the addressing, so ports and addresses.

One of the flags is used altering the configuration of the application (see section \ref{sec:cmd_config} for configuration options). A configuration file path can be specified in 3 ways
\newpage
\begin{itemize}
  \item environmental variable \texttt{PQCOM\_CONFIG}\,--\,this variable can be set to point to the configuration file,
  \item the \texttt{-\--config} flag\,--\,a relative or absolute path to the configuration file,
  \item default path\,--\,if the above two are not specified a default configuration path will be used, it is listed as the config directory in appendix \ref{ch:directories_app}.
\end{itemize}
