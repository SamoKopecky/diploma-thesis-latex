In this mode, the application is run in read-only mode and can only display or save sent data. As the data is read it can either be
\begin{itemize}
  \item redirected through the stdout (standard output) of the terminal to a different command via the pipe (|) operator or redirected to a file via the redirect operator (>),
  \item saved directly to a new file, by supplying the destination directory where the new files will be created.
\end{itemize}
To choose one of these options command flags have to be used, if no flag is supplied the data is sent to stdout. By supplying the flag \texttt{-\--dir [directory]} the second option can be used. The supplied directory can be either an absolute or relative path.
