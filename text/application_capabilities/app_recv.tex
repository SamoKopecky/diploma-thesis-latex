In this mode the application is ran in read-only mode and can only display or save sent data. As the data is read it can either be
\begin{itemize}
  \item redirected trough the stdout (standard output) of the terminal to a different command via the pipe (|) operator or redirected to a file via the redirect operator (>),
  \item saved directly to a new file, by supplying the destination directory where the new files will be created.
\end{itemize}
To choose of one these options flags are used, if no flag is supplied the data is sent to stdout, if the flag \texttt{-\--dir [directory]} can be used. The supplied directory can be either an absolute or relative path.
